# Penumbra
Mr. Penumbra's 24-Hour Book Store is a book written by <a href="https://www.robinsloan.com/" alt="Robin Sloan">Robin Sloan</a>. This is a website based on the contents of the book, intended to display my coding ability. I do not claim ownership of any of the content on the page, including the website name.

This project showcases these new skills: 
<ol>
  <li>Using JavaScript to build a sticky nav that collapses when a user scrolls past a certain number of pixels</li> 
  <li>Using JavaScript, rather than CSS, to control hover states</li>
  <li>Using Leaflet to display an interactive map on the homepage</li>
  <li>Using the Google Books API to display an ebook on the About page</li> 
  <li>Using a window alert to let users know that they're leaving the site when they click "More" in the navbar</li>
</ol>
